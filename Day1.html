			<p><b>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</b> is a frame work that defines activity that are performed during software development process.</p>
<p>There are 6 phases in SDLC model as given below.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20191026205203/sdlc1.png" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Requirement:</strong><br />
In this phase all the requirement are collected from customer/client. They are provided in a document called   Businessmen requirement specification (BRS) and System requirement specification (SRS). All the detail are discuss with customer/client in detail.</p>
<p><strong>2. Design:</strong><br />
It has two steps:</p><br/>
<ul>
<li><b>(a). High level design (HLD):</b> It give the architecture of software product.
</li>
<li><b>(b). Low level design (LLD):</b> It describe how each and every feature  in the product should work and  every component.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the longest phase.
</li>
<li>This phase consists of Front end + Middle ware + Back-end
</li>
<li>In font end: development coding are done even SEO setting are done
</li>
<li>In Middle ware: They connect both font end and back end
</li>
<li>In back-end: database is created
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Testing:</strong><br />
Testing is carried out to verify the entire system. The aim of the tester is to find out the gaps and defects within the system and also to check whether the system is running according to the requirement of the customer/client.</p>
<p><strong>5. Deployment:</strong><br />

Moreover, these programmes are also given permanent affiliation w.e.f. A.Y. 2015-16.

The Institute applied for 2nd time accreditation for its UG Programmes i.e. EXTC, IT and CMPN, and 1st time accreditation of Electronics Engineering (ETRX) as it became eligible after three batches passed out in 2015. All these programmes were accredited for 3 years w.e.f. 01-07-2016. The ETRX programme is also given permanent affiliation w.e.f. A.Y. 2017-18.
